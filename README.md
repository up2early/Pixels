# Pixels
A Blockchain Based Art Project

## TODO
- Frontend
  - [x] Create React app to display the pixels from a list of colors
  - [ ] Update display algorithm to be deterministic so pixels don't shift around as more are added
    - Idea: First pixel is in the center or just one offset from the center and all others are drawn in a spiral around it
    - Idea: Mess around and make some interesting ways to display them
    - Idea: Make 3D display
  - [ ] Add wallet connect and metamask support
  - [ ] Implement a way to update your pixel from the React website
- Backend
  - Create contract
